This is my quick python library to find a sequence of bytes in a binary.

There are probably a lot better implementations of this out there so I dunno if this is something you want to use, but if you feel like it suits your purpose then go for it. This code isn't really efficient and this shouldn't be used in any performance critical task and this is probably covered in bugs, but idc..
